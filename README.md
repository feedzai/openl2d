# **O**pen**L2D**

## Abstract

Public resource limitations have significantly hindered the development and benchmarking of learning to defer (L2D) algorithms, which aim to optimally combine human and AI capabilities in hybrid decision-making systems. In such systems, human availability and domain-specific concerns introduce complexity, while obtaining human predictions for training and evaluation is costly. To overcome these challenges, we introduce OpenL2D, a novel framework designed to generate synthetic expert decisions and testbed settings for L2D methods. OpenL2D facilitates the creation of synthetic experts with adjustable bias and feature dependence, simulates realistic human work capacity constraints, and provides diverse training and testing scenarios. To demonstrate its utility, we employ OpenL2D on a public fraud detection dataset, synthesizing a team of 50 fraud analysts, and we benchmark L2D baselines under an array of 220 distinct testing scenarios. We believe that OpenL2D will serve as a pivotal instrument in facilitating a systematic, rigorous, reproducible, and transparent evaluation and comparison of L2D methods, thereby fostering the development of more synergistic human-AI collaboration in decision-making systems.

## Using the OpenL2D Fraud Detection Dataset

In our experiments, for training and testing of assignment methods, we utilized the **OpenL2D Fraud Detection Dataset**. This dataset is comprised of:

* An Input Dataset.
* Synthetic Expert prediction table.
* Dataset with limited expert predictions.
* Sets of capacity constraint tables.

For more information on each of these components, please consult the provided [Datasheet](documents/datasheet.pdf).

* ### Step 1: Download the Code in this repo:
The sets of capacity constraint tables and the synthetic expert prediction table are generated by using the input dataset and a set of configs included in this repo. For easy use of our dataset and available notebooks, we encourage users to download the repo in its entirety.

* ### Step 2: Download the Input Dataset
Our input dataset is the base variant of the Bank Account Fraud Tabular Dataset, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgpjesus/bank-account-fraud-dataset-neurips-2022?resource=download&select=Base.csv). This dataset should then be placed in the folder "/data".

* ### Step 3: Download the Models, Dataset with limited expert predictions and other necessary data.
The models used in our experiments and the dataset with limited expert predictions are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nAUlxdOmwC6ZNtch3rxwKwNUVrYNmxkV). We also include the transformed input dataset in order to generate synthetic experts with our framework. 

* ### Step 4: Generating the expert prediction table and capacity constraint tables

To place all the necessary data in the correct directories, and generate the synthetic expert prediction table utilized in our experiments, as well as the capacity constraint tables used in our benchmarks, the user needs to run [this script](asdfadf). The script only requires the user to specify the directory of the datasets downloaded from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nAUlxdOmwC6ZNtch3rxwKwNUVrYNmxkV).
